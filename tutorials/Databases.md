# Use of Data Resources

Practical developed by Dr. Susan Steinbusch and Dr. Lars Eijssen

## Introduction 
With these practical sessions, you will learn how to use online resources to investigate a disease.
Besides textbooks and papers, databases nowadays are important sources of up-to-date information,
from which you can already benefit as study materials.
Several resources will be addressed during this practical: first one disease database (OMIM), second a
pathway database (WikiPathways), and last one genomic databases (Ensembl).

#### Aim

Get acquainted with online resources to find out more about diseases, their relationship to molecular
pathways and the function of involved genes.

## Use of Online Data Resources for Molecular Biology

#### Assignment 1: Important Biological Databases
Watch the video on [Important Biological Databases](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrUcxVJOwL0). Answer the questions at the end of the video,
which are also described below. A suitable book for further reading is “Lacroix, Z., & Critchlow, T. (2003).
Bioinformatics : Managing scientific data . San Francisco.” Available as e-book from the Maastricht
University Library (this reference is not mandatory reading material for the preparatory assignment).

**Questions related to the video:**
* **a.** Explain the relevance of Biological Databases in Bioinformatics.
* **b.** Briefly describe the different types of Sequence Databases.
* **c.** Describe Entrez Search Engine.
* **d.** Explain the Primary Nucleotide sequence database


#### Assignment 2: Genetic Variants in the SHH gene in OMIM

“The SHH gene encodes sonic hedgehog, a secreted protein that is involved in establishing cell fates at
several points during development.” [OMIM: 600725]. There are several diseases associated with this
gene.
Look up the SHH gene in [OMIM](https://omim.org/), a database at NCBI, which contains expert-curated
information on the links between genes and genetic variants and human disease.

* **a.** To which diseases has the gene been linked, which identifiers are mentioned for these diseases
(displayed in the table as “Phenotype MIM number”) and with which inheritance pattern (if
known)?

* **b.** How many literature references have been used to construct this page for OMIM, and when was
the page last updated?

Open the Table View of Allelic Variants for the SHH gene from the left-side menu.
* **c.** How many mutations are described in OMIM and which types of mutations do they include?

* **d.** Which phenotype has been associated with the largest amount of the described variants?

Take a closer look at variant 600725.0002 from the table
* **e.** Answer the following questions
  * **I.** Which change(s) in the protein are reported?
  * **II.** At which position in the protein is this change reported?
  * **III.** What is the rs number of the SNP?
  * **IV.** Which base changed in the gene?
  * **V.** What is consequence of this change?
Click on the link for variant 600725.0004.
  * **VI.** How many literature references have described this variant? Describe in your own
words, what these references found on the influence of this particular variant on the
transcribed protein

#### Assignment 3: The biological context of SHH from WikiPathways
The SHH protein play a vital role in development and the differentiation of multiple cell types, including
neuronal cells. Look up the human “Oligodendrocyte Specification and differentiation (including
remyelination), leading to Myelin Components for CNS” pathway in WikiPathways
(https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP4304). This database (WikiPathways) shows you
interactive drawings of pathway diagrams, which help to understand the biological context of genes,
proteins and metabolites.

* **a.** In which step(s) does the SHH protein play a role according to this pathway?

* **b.** Which other protein(s) are needed for this step(s), and which protein(s) inhibit this step?

Click on the SHH box, to display its identifiers from several other databases.
* **c.** What are the Entrez Gene (NCBI Gene), Ensembl, RefSeq, HGNC symbol and Uniprot identifiers
of the human SHH gene or protein? Tip: click on the grey arrow in the pop-up box for each of
the database names.

* **d.** Which of these databases give you information on a gene, and which one on a protein? Why can
it be relevant to make a distinction between these two for biological databases?

* **e.** There are also other databases linked to a gene, such as OMIM (which you looked at for
assignment 2). Which identifiers are linked from WikiPathways to OMIM? Compare these
numbers with the ones you found for question 2a. Are these numbers the same?

Even though there is much more information that can be gained from this database, we will now
continue to a database with lots of details on genes and the function of a gene, called Ensembl, which is
database containing information on comparative genomics, evolution, sequence variation and
transcriptional regulation. You can go to the Ensembl page for the human SHH encoding gene, by
clicking on the link provided at WikiPathways (or by this [link](http://ensemblgenomes.org/id/ENSG00000164690).

#### Assignment 4: Genetic and functional information on SHH from ENSEMBL
You will now study the SHH gene in more detail, and part of the function of the protein encoded by the
SHH gene. For this we will use Ensembl, which is database containing information on comparative
genomics, evolution, sequence variation and transcriptional regulation. *Note: If too many people from
the same country/IP-address try to use Ensembl, it can respond slowly. If that happens, click
’Mirrors’ at the top of the page and try another mirror; this will guide you to a similar website,
related to another country.*

* **a.** What are other names of this gene, besides to official HGNC name SHH?
* **b.** What is the chromosomal position (chromosome, location, and strand) of this gene?
* **c.** How many transcripts (splice variants) are known for this gene? How many are protein
coding?
* **d.** Give the name of one Gene Ontology (GO) annotation for each of the three GO domains
(cellular component, molecular function, biological process). Pick annotations that originate
from Uniprot, which are related to the basal lamina (which influencing cell differentiation,
migration, and adhesion)
* **e.** Explain in your own words, how Gene Ontology terms can aid you, if you want to do
research on a gene (start with
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_Ontology_Term_Enrichment ).

#### Assignment 5.  Another biological context of SHH from WikiPathways
Look up the human “Differentiation Pathway” in WikiPathways
(https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP2848). This database (WikiPathways) shows you
interactive drawings of pathway diagrams, which help to understand the biological context of genes,
proteins and metabolites.
* **a.** In which step(s) does the SHH protein play a role according to this pathway? (Tip: search for SHH
with the key-shortcut ctrl + f, to see it light up in the pathway)
* **b.** Which other protein(s) are needed for the step to develop oligodendrocytes? Is this finding in
line with the information you saw in preparatory question 3b?
* **c.** Which other compound(s) are needed for the step to develop spinal motor neurons?

Click on the box of this compound (in blue), to display its identifiers from several other databases.
* **d.** What are the HMDB, CHEBI, Pubchem compound and Wikidata identifiers of this compound?
Tip: click on the grey arrow in the pop-up box for each of the database names.

Even though we could go into more detail on chemical compounds with help of the databases
mentioned in question 5d, we will now return to the SHH gene. We will continue to a database with
more details on genes and the function of a gene, called Entrez Gene from NCBI. You can go to the NCBI
page for the human SHH encoding gene, by clicking on the link provided at WikiPathways (or by this [link](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6469).

#### Assignment 6. Genetic and functional information on SHH from NCBI 
NCBI gene is a database that integrates information from a wide range of species. A record on a gene
may include nomenclature, Reference Sequences (RefSeqs), maps, pathways, variations, phenotypes,
and links to genome-, phenotype-, and locus-specific resources worldwide.

* **a.** What is the NCBI Gene identifier of this gene?
* **b.** What are other names of this gene, besides to official HGNC name SHH?
* **c.** Compare your answer from question 2b to question 4a from the preparatory assignments. Are
there similarities or differences? How could differences in names influence your research in
other databases? How do databases try to minimalise this influence?
* **d.** Give the RefSeq identifier of one of the mRNA, with the corresponding RefSeq ID and name for
the protein for one of its splice variants.
* **e.** Explain in your own words what Ref-Seq identifiers are, which different categories there are,
and how they can aid you, if you want to do research on the relationship between a gene and a
protein (start with https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RefSeq).
* **f.** How many exons does the gene have (total regardless of transcript) (see ‘exon count’)?
* **g.** In which tissue is this gene expressed most (scroll down to ‘Expression’).?
* **h.** Name all the seven pathways from WikiPathways, in which the gene is involved.
* **i.** Explain in your own words for two of these pathways, why SHH plays a role in them
